# onflick
Flickr image gallery using Android Jetpack libraries

Using a modern approach and the newest libraries I developed a sample Flickr photo feed. The main focus of the app is to provide a clean and scalable architecture, with separation of concerns, mantainability and testability.

I try to combine the benefits of features, frameworks and libraries to write concise code that covers the main tasks a business application should handle
